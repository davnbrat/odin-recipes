    <p class="description">Mamaws divinity recipe. This was taught to my dad and I by the woman herself. Many people have not heard of this candy and if they have what you typical find does not taste like this receipe. This is great to bring for Christmas gatherings but can be made anytime of the year. This one takes a little bit of effort to get right but the good part is it tastes good even if it doesn't setup.</p>
    <p><strong>Helpful tips:</strong> Humidity place a big factor in the candy "setting up". Look for days with low humidity. I have found that getting the water warm before stirring in the sugar will help it dissolve. You will need a candy thermometer as the temperature is important. Make sure to set the eggs out ahead of time so that they are room temperate when you start. If mixture becomes to stiff to manipulate you can add a few drops of hot water. If it does not harden you can cook over hot water until the mixture holds its shape.</p>
